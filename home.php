        <h2>WotStrat is live!</h2>
            Today marks the official launch of WotStrat. The purpose of this site is two-fold:
            1. To provide World of Tanks related tools for gathering/analyzing various tank stats and information.
            2. Act as a sandbox for me to work on/play with web technology.
            I have a bunch of plans for things I want to do here, so if you check in every once in a while
            you'll probably see some new stuff being added.
